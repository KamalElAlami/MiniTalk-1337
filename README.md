# MiniTalk - My 1337 Project Journey ðŸ“¡

## Description
"MiniTalk" is a project undertaken during my time at 1337 FIL, focusing on inter-process communication (IPC) using signals in the UNIX environment. This project challenged me to develop a client-server application where processes communicate with each other using signals.

## Project Overview
The "MiniTalk" project aims to provide hands-on experience with IPC mechanisms in UNIX-based operating systems, specifically signal handling. By completing this project, students gain practical knowledge and skills in designing and implementing communication protocols between processes.

## Key Features
1. **Client-Server Architecture:** Implement a client-server model where one process (client) sends messages to another process (server) using signals.
2. **Signal Handling:** Handle signal transmission and reception between client and server processes, ensuring reliable communication.
3. **Message Encoding:** Encode messages into signals for transmission and decode signals into messages upon reception, maintaining data integrity.
4. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling mechanisms to detect and handle signal transmission errors, ensuring robustness and reliability.
5. **User Interface:** Develop a user interface for the client and server processes to facilitate interaction and message exchange.

## Usage
To use "MiniTalk" in your project:
1. Compile and run the server process, specifying the desired port number or other configuration parameters.
2. Compile and run the client process, providing the server's address and port number as command-line arguments.
3. Use the client interface to send messages to the server, which processes and responds accordingly.

## Challenges Faced
During the "MiniTalk" project, I encountered challenges with:
1. Understanding Signal Handling: Grasping the concepts and mechanisms of signal handling in UNIX systems, including signal types, signal handlers, and signal delivery.
2. Synchronization and Timing Issues: Dealing with synchronization issues between client and server processes, ensuring timely and accurate message exchange.
3. Error Handling and Debugging: Identifying and resolving signal transmission errors, debugging issues related to signal handling and message processing.

## Reflection
The "MiniTalk" project provided valuable insights into inter-process communication using signals, expanding my understanding of IPC mechanisms in UNIX environments. It challenged me to implement communication protocols and error handling strategies, fostering problem-solving skills and critical thinking.

## Conclusion
"MiniTalk" served as an enriching project that deepened my knowledge of IPC and signal handling in UNIX systems. It provided a practical foundation for understanding and implementing communication protocols between processes, paving the way for further exploration and specialization in the field of system programming and network communication.
